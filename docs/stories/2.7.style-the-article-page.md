# Story 2.7: Style the Article Page

### Status
- **Draft**

### Story
**As a** User,
**I want** to read tool articles in a clean, well-formatted, and responsive layout,
**so that** I have a pleasant and effective reading experience on any device.

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  [ ] The dynamic article page (`src/pages/tools/[tool]/[...slug].astro`) is styled using Tailwind CSS, consistent with the overall site design.
2.  [ ] The layout is fully responsive, adhering to the mobile-first strategy and official project breakpoints.
3.  [ ] All typographic elements (headings, paragraphs, lists, blockquotes) are styled for maximum readability.
4.  [ ] Code blocks are styled with appropriate syntax highlighting.
5.  [ ] Images within the content are responsive and properly constrained.
6.  [ ] A layout component (e.g., `ArticleLayout.astro`) is used to ensure a consistent structure.

### Tasks / Subtasks
-   [ ] Task 1: Create a new layout file, e.g., `src/layouts/ToolArticleLayout.astro`.
-   [ ] Task 2: Apply a consistent page structure within the layout, including a main content area with appropriate padding and max-width.
-   [ ] Task 3: Use the `@tailwindcss/typography` plugin or custom styles to format the rendered Markdown content.
-   [ ] Task 4: Ensure the layout follows the mobile-first approach, using `min-width` media queries for larger screens.
-   [ ] Task 5: Refactor `src/pages/tools/[tool]/[...slug].astro` to use the new layout component.
-   [ ] Task 6: Test the article page on all specified breakpoints to ensure proper rendering.

### Dev Notes
This story is the foundation for all subsequent work in this epic. The following architectural and design standards **must** be adhered to in all related stories.

#### Responsive Design Strategy
-   **Mobile-First Approach:** All UI components and layouts must be developed mobile-first. Styles should be written for the smallest breakpoint (`320px`) first, and then use `min-width` media queries to add or adjust styles for larger screens.

#### Breakpoints
-   The following official project breakpoints must be used:
    -   `320px` (Smallest mobile devices)
    -   `640px` (sm, Large mobile / small tablets)
    -   `768px` (md, Tablets)
    -   `1024px` (lg, Laptops/Desktops)
    -   `1280px` (xl, Large desktops)

#### CSS Unit Usage Guide
-   **REM:** This is the **preferred and default unit** for most CSS properties, including `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, and `width`/`height` on containers. It ensures a predictable and scalable design relative to the root font size.
-   **EM:** Use `em` units for properties that need to scale relative to the `font-size` of their direct parent. This is useful for things like the padding on a button or the size of an icon within a text element.
-   **PX:** Use `px` units sparingly and only for properties that require a fixed, non-scalable value. Good use cases include `border-width`, `box-shadow` offsets, or the dimensions of a raster image like a logo.
