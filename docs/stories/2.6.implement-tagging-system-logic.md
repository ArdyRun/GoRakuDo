# Story 2.6: Implement Tagging System Logic

### Status
- **Draft**

### Story
**As a** User,
**I want** to find articles that are relevant across different tools,
**so that** I can discover related content and understand how tools can be used together.

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  [ ] The data-fetching logic on the tool index page (`src/pages/tools/[tool]/index.astro`) is updated.
2.  [ ] Instead of filtering by parent folder, the page now filters articles based on the `tags` array in the frontmatter.
3.  [ ] An article will appear on the `/tools/anki` index page if its `tags` array contains the string `'anki'`.
4.  [ ] An article with `tags: ['anki', 'yomitan']` will correctly appear on both the `/tools/anki` and `/tools/yomitan` index pages.

### Tasks / Subtasks
-   [ ] Task 1: Open `src/pages/tools/[tool]/index.astro`.
-   [ ] Task 2: Modify the data fetching and filtering logic.
-   [ ] Task 3: Instead of checking the article's slug/path, the filter should now check if `entry.data.tags` includes the current `tool` parameter from the URL.
-   [ ] Task 4: Create a test article with multiple tags to verify that it appears on all corresponding index pages.
-   [ ] Task 5: Remove the test article after verification.

### Dev Notes
This story is the foundation for all subsequent work in this epic. The following architectural and design standards **must** be adhered to in all related stories.

#### Responsive Design Strategy
-   **Mobile-First Approach:** All UI components and layouts must be developed mobile-first. Styles should be written for the smallest breakpoint (`320px`) first, and then use `min-width` media queries to add or adjust styles for larger screens.

#### Breakpoints
-   The following official project breakpoints must be used:
    -   `320px` (Smallest mobile devices)
    -   `640px` (sm, Large mobile / small tablets)
    -   `768px` (md, Tablets)
    -   `1024px` (lg, Laptops/Desktops)
    -   `1280px` (xl, Large desktops)

#### CSS Unit Usage Guide
-   **REM:** This is the **preferred and default unit** for most CSS properties, including `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, and `width`/`height` on containers. It ensures a predictable and scalable design relative to the root font size.
-   **EM:** Use `em` units for properties that need to scale relative to the `font-size` of their direct parent. This is useful for things like the padding on a button or the size of an icon within a text element.
-   **PX:** Use `px` units sparingly and only for properties that require a fixed, non-scalable value. Good use cases include `border-width`, `box-shadow` offsets, or the dimensions of a raster image like a logo.
