# Story 2.10: Implement Breadcrumb Navigation

### Status
- **Draft**

### Story
**As a** User,
**I want** to see a clear breadcrumb trail on the tool documentation pages,
**so that** I can easily understand my current location in the site hierarchy and navigate back to parent pages.

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  [ ] A reusable `Breadcrumb.astro` component is created.
2.  [ ] The breadcrumb component is added to the layout used by the tool index and article pages.
3.  [ ] On a tool index page (e.g., `/tools/anki`), the breadcrumb displays: `Home > Tools > Anki`.
4.  [ ] On a tool article page (e.g., `/tools/anki/apa-itu-anki`), the breadcrumb displays: `Home > Tools > Anki > Apa Itu Anki`.
5.  [ ] Each part of the breadcrumb (except the last one) is a link to the corresponding page.
6.  [ ] The component is styled and responsive according to the project's design standards.

### Tasks / Subtasks
-   [ ] Task 1: Create a new component file at `src/components/Breadcrumb.astro`.
-   [ ] Task 2: Implement the component to accept an array of path segments (e.g., `[{label: 'Home', href: '/'}, ...]`).
-   [ ] Task 3: Add logic to the component to render the list of segments and links.
-   [ ] Task 4: In the article and index page layouts, dynamically generate the array of segments based on the current URL.
-   [ ] Task 5: Pass the segments array as a prop to the `Breadcrumb` component.
-   [ ] Task 6: Apply responsive styling to the breadcrumb component.
-   [ ] Task 7: Test the breadcrumb on both index and article pages to ensure it displays and links correctly.

### Dev Notes
This story is the foundation for all subsequent work in this epic. The following architectural and design standards **must** be adhered to in all related stories.

#### Responsive Design Strategy
-   **Mobile-First Approach:** All UI components and layouts must be developed mobile-first. Styles should be written for the smallest breakpoint (`320px`) first, and then use `min-width` media queries to add or adjust styles for larger screens.

#### Breakpoints
-   The following official project breakpoints must be used:
    -   `320px` (Smallest mobile devices)
    -   `640px` (sm, Large mobile / small tablets)
    -   `768px` (md, Tablets)
    -   `1024px` (lg, Laptops/Desktops)
    -   `1280px` (xl, Large desktops)

#### CSS Unit Usage Guide
-   **REM:** This is the **preferred and default unit** for most CSS properties, including `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, and `width`/`height` on containers. It ensures a predictable and scalable design relative to the root font size.
-   **EM:** Use `em` units for properties that need to scale relative to the `font-size` of their direct parent. This is useful for things like the padding on a button or the size of an icon within a text element.
-   **PX:** Use `px` units sparingly and only for properties that require a fixed, non-scalable value. Good use cases include `border-width`, `box-shadow` offsets, or the dimensions of a raster image like a logo.
