### Dev Notes
This is the final production readiness story for the epic. The following architectural and design standards **must** be adhered to:

#### Production Readiness Standards
- **Performance Targets**: Core Web Vitals must meet or exceed targets
- **Security Requirements**: Zero critical or high-severity vulnerabilities
- **Reliability**: 99.9% uptime target with proper error handling
- **Accessibility**: WCAG 2.1 AA compliance mandatory
- **SEO**: All pages must have proper meta tags and structured data

#### Critical Production Considerations

**ðŸš¨ PRODUCTION CRITICAL - DO NOT DEPLOY WITHOUT COMPLETING:**
1. **Security Audit**: Must pass all security scans
2. **Performance Validation**: Must meet all Core Web Vitals targets
3. **Error Handling**: Must have comprehensive fallback mechanisms
4. **Content Validation**: All articles must pass schema validation
5. **Testing**: All critical user journeys must pass
6. **Test File Cleanup**: All test artifacts must be safely removed

**ðŸ”’ PRODUCTION SECURITY REQUIREMENTS:**
- Input validation on all dynamic routes
- XSS prevention measures
- Path traversal protection
- Proper error handling without information disclosure
- Security headers implementation
- CSP policy validation

**âš¡ PRODUCTION PERFORMANCE REQUIREMENTS:**
- Build time: < 10 seconds total
- Bundle size: < 100KB per page
- Core Web Vitals: LCP < 2s, FID < 75ms, CLS < 0.1
- Page load time: < 3s on 3G connection
- Memory usage: < 50MB increase from baseline

**â™¿ PRODUCTION ACCESSIBILITY REQUIREMENTS:**
- WCAG 2.1 AA compliance mandatory
- Proper heading hierarchy (h1 â†’ h2 â†’ h3)
- Alt text for all images
- Semantic HTML markup
- Keyboard navigation support
- Screen reader compatibility

**ðŸ§¹ TEST FILE CLEANUP REQUIREMENTS:**
- **Comprehensive Analysis**: Scan entire codebase for test artifacts
- **Safe Removal**: Remove only test-related files without breaking production code
- **Validation**: Verify all functionality works after cleanup
- **Documentation**: Record all removed files and cleanup procedures
- **Build Verification**: Ensure build process completes successfully after cleanup
- **No Test Artifacts**: Zero test files, debug logs, or development artifacts in production

#### Responsive Design Strategy
- **Mobile-First Approach**: All optimizations must maintain mobile-first design
- **Breakpoints**: Maintain 320px, 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px standards
- **Performance**: Ensure optimizations don't break responsive behavior

#### CSS Unit Usage Guide
- **REM**: Preferred for most properties (font-size, margin, padding, width/height)
- **EM**: Use for properties that scale relative to parent font-size
- **PX**: Use sparingly for fixed values (border-width, box-shadow offsets)
