# Story 2.8: Style the Tool Index Page

### Status
- **Draft**

### Story
**As a** User,
**I want** to browse articles on the tool index page in a visually appealing and organized way,
**so that** I can easily scan the available topics and find what I'm looking for.

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  [ ] The tool index page (`src/pages/tools/[tool]/index.astro`) is styled using Tailwind CSS.
2.  [ ] The layout for the list of articles is a responsive grid of cards, similar in style to the main `/tools` page.
3.  [ ] Each article card displays the article's `title`, `description`, and `tags`.
4.  [ ] The entire card is clickable and links to the corresponding article page.
5.  [ ] The layout is fully responsive and adheres to the mobile-first strategy and all project breakpoints.

### Tasks / Subtasks
-   [ ] Task 1: Create a reusable `ArticleCard.astro` component to display article information.
-   [ ] Task 2: Style the card component to be consistent with the site's design system.
-   [ ] Task 3: In `src/pages/tools/[tool]/index.astro`, replace the unstyled list with a responsive grid layout.
-   [ ] Task 4: Use the new `ArticleCard.astro` component to display each article in the grid.
-   [ ] Task 5: Ensure the grid adapts correctly to all specified breakpoints.
-   [ ] Task 6: Add a title to the page, such as "Anki Articles", to provide context.

### Dev Notes
This story is the foundation for all subsequent work in this epic. The following architectural and design standards **must** be adhered to in all related stories.

#### Responsive Design Strategy
-   **Mobile-First Approach:** All UI components and layouts must be developed mobile-first. Styles should be written for the smallest breakpoint (`320px`) first, and then use `min-width` media queries to add or adjust styles for larger screens.

#### Breakpoints
-   The following official project breakpoints must be used:
    -   `320px` (Smallest mobile devices)
    -   `640px` (sm, Large mobile / small tablets)
    -   `768px` (md, Tablets)
    -   `1024px` (lg, Laptops/Desktops)
    -   `1280px` (xl, Large desktops)

#### CSS Unit Usage Guide
-   **REM:** This is the **preferred and default unit** for most CSS properties, including `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, and `width`/`height` on containers. It ensures a predictable and scalable design relative to the root font size.
-   **EM:** Use `em` units for properties that need to scale relative to the `font-size` of their direct parent. This is useful for things like the padding on a button or the size of an icon within a text element.
-   **PX:** Use `px` units sparingly and only for properties that require a fixed, non-scalable value. Good use cases include `border-width`, `box-shadow` offsets, or the dimensions of a raster image like a logo.
