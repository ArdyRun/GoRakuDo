```

### Technical Context
- **Framework**: Astro.js 5.13.0 with Vue.js 3.5.18 integration
- **Search Library**: Fuse.js 7.1.0 for client-side fuzzy search
- **Language Support**: Bilingual search (English + Indonesian with custom stop words)
- **Current State**: 44 TypeScript warnings (VERIFIED baseline, target: reduce to 43)
- **Performance**: Pre-generated search index, client-side processing
- **Integration Points**: Content collections, Fuse.js, Vue components, API endpoints
- **Previous Cleanup**: Story 3.1A successfully removed unused `findFuzzyMatches` method

### Architecture Alignment
This cleanup aligns with GoRakuDo architecture principles:
- **Performance First**: Removing 27-line unused method reduces bundle size
- **Search Optimization**: Maintaining fast, accurate bilingual search
- **Code Quality**: Following TypeScript strict mode and coding standards
- **Indonesian Language**: Preserving stop words and language-specific processing

### Implementation Considerations
- **Risk Level**: LOW - Straightforward unused method removal, no dependencies
- **Impact Assessment**: Method is completely unused, safe for removal
- **Testing Strategy**: Manual testing of all search scenarios (English/Indonesian)
- **Rollback Plan**: Git revert with SearchEngine.ts.backup restoration
- **Performance Impact**: Expected bundle size reduction, memory optimization

### Search Engine Architecture (CURRENT STATE - VERIFIED)
```typescript
// TARGET METHOD FOR REMOVAL (lines 423-449):
private levenshteinDistance(str1: string, str2: string): number {
  // 27-line Levenshtein distance algorithm implementation
  // VERIFIED UNUSED: No references found in entire codebase
  // HISTORICAL CONTEXT: Was used by findFuzzyMatches (removed in Story 3.1A)
  // IMPACT: Safe for complete removal, reduces bundle size by ~27 lines
  const matrix: number[][] = [];
  // ... complete matrix algorithm implementation (23 lines)
  return matrix[str2.length][str1.length];
}

// PRESERVE ALL OTHER ELEMENTS:
public performSearch(query: string): SearchResponse    // ‚úÖ ACTIVE - Used by search API
public generateContentSnippet(...): string             // ‚úÖ ACTIVE - Used by search UI
public highlightText(...): string                     // ‚úÖ ACTIVE - Used by search UI
private isInitialized: boolean = false;               // ‚úÖ ACTIVE - Guards public methods
```

### Technical Verification Methodology
**Comprehensive Analysis Performed (2024-12-28):**
- **Method References**: `levenshteinDistance\(` - ZERO matches found in entire codebase
- **Dynamic References**: `this\['levenshteinDistance'\]` - ZERO matches found
- **String References**: `levenshteinDistance` - Only found in method definition itself
- **Import Analysis**: SearchEngine.ts is self-contained (no external imports)
- **TypeScript Warnings**: `npx astro check` confirmed method flagged as unused (ts(6133))
- **Historical Context**: Method was used by `findFuzzyMatches` (removed in Story 3.1A)
- **File Verification**: Method confirmed at lines 423-449 in current SearchEngine.ts
- **Cross-Reference Check**: Verified no usage in SearchUI.vue, docs.astro, or API endpoints
