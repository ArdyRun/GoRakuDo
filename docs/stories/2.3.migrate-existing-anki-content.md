# Story 2.3: Migrate Existing Anki Content

### Status
- **Draft**

### Story
**As a** Content Manager,
**I want** to migrate the existing Anki article into the new content collection structure and update its frontmatter,
**so that** it conforms to the new schema and can be rendered by the dynamic pages.

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  [ ] The existing file `apa-itu-anki.md` is located at `src/content/tools/anki/apa-itu-anki.md`.
2.  [ ] The frontmatter of the file is updated to match the `tool-articles` schema.
3.  [ ] The frontmatter includes all required fields: `title`, `description`, `publishedDate`, and `tags`. Optional fields may be added as needed.
4.  [ ] The content of the article remains unchanged.

### Tasks / Subtasks
-   [ ] Task 1: Locate the `apa-itu-anki.md` file.
-   [ ] Task 2: Open the file for editing.
-   [ ] Task 3: Review the existing frontmatter and add/update fields to match the schema defined in Story 2.1.
-   [ ] Task 4: Ensure the `tags` field is an array containing at least the string `'anki'`.
-   [ ] Task 5: Save the file and verify that it can be correctly parsed by Astro.

### Dev Notes
This story is the foundation for all subsequent work in this epic. The following architectural and design standards **must** be adhered to in all related stories.

#### Responsive Design Strategy
-   **Mobile-First Approach:** All UI components and layouts must be developed mobile-first. Styles should be written for the smallest breakpoint (`320px`) first, and then use `min-width` media queries to add or adjust styles for larger screens.

#### Breakpoints
-   The following official project breakpoints must be used:
    -   `320px` (Smallest mobile devices)
    -   `640px` (sm, Large mobile / small tablets)
    -   `768px` (md, Tablets)
    -   `1024px` (lg, Laptops/Desktops)
    -   `1280px` (xl, Large desktops)

#### CSS Unit Usage Guide
-   **REM:** This is the **preferred and default unit** for most CSS properties, including `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, and `width`/`height` on containers. It ensures a predictable and scalable design relative to the root font size.
-   **EM:** Use `em` units for properties that need to scale relative to the `font-size` of their direct parent. This is useful for things like the padding on a button or the size of an icon within a text element.
-   **PX:** Use `px` units sparingly and only for properties that require a fixed, non-scalable value. Good use cases include `border-width`, `box-shadow` offsets, or the dimensions of a raster image like a logo.
