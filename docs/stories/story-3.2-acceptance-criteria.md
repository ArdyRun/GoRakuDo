# Story 3.2: Word Processing Cleanup - Acceptance Criteria

## Story Overview
Clean unused functions, parameters, and variables in word-to-link-converter.ts while maintaining all word processing and linking functionality.

## Acceptance Criteria

### Functional Requirements
- [ ] All unused functions in word-to-link-converter.ts are removed:
  - [ ] `calculatePositionScore` function removed
  - [ ] `findOptimalSingleLinkPosition` function removed
  - [ ] `removeLinksFromHeaders` function removed
  - [ ] `calculatePartialMatchRelevance` function removed
  - [ ] `getWordContext` function removed
  - [ ] `isWordInHeaderContext` function removed
- [ ] All unused parameters in remaining functions are removed
- [ ] All unused variables (wordIndex, sectionIndex, trimmedLine) are removed
- [ ] All unused imports are removed

### Non-Functional Requirements
- [ ] No TypeScript errors introduced
- [ ] No TypeScript warnings introduced
- [ ] Word processing performance maintained or improved
- [ ] Memory usage reduced (unused variables removed)
- [ ] Code readability improved

### Compatibility Requirements
- [ ] Word-to-link conversion functionality remains intact
- [ ] Internal linking system works correctly
- [ ] Content processing pipeline unaffected
- [ ] Link generation accuracy maintained
- [ ] Performance benchmarks met

### Testing Requirements
- [ ] Word processing tested with various content types
- [ ] Link conversion accuracy verified
- [ ] Performance benchmarks completed
- [ ] `npx astro check` shows warnings reduced
- [ ] `npm run build` completes successfully
- [ ] No runtime errors in content processing

### Documentation Requirements
- [ ] Changes documented in commit message
- [ ] Code comments preserved where relevant
- [ ] Function documentation updated if needed

## Definition of Done
- [ ] All acceptance criteria met
- [ ] Word processing functionality thoroughly tested
- [ ] Link generation tested across different content
