# Story 2.4: Create Dynamic Article Page Layout

### Status
- **Draft**

### Story
**As a** User,
**I want** to be able to view the content of a tool article when I navigate to its URL,
**so that** I can read the documentation and guides.

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  [ ] A new dynamic route file is created at `src/pages/tools/[tool]/[...slug].astro`.
2.  [ ] The page uses `getStaticPaths` to generate a unique URL and page for every article in the `tool-articles` collection.
3.  [ ] The page correctly fetches the article's data (title, frontmatter, content) based on the URL slug.
4.  [ ] The page renders the article's `title` in an `<h1>` tag and the main body content using Astro's `<Content />` component.
5.  [ ] For this story, the page can be unstyled, focusing only on functionality. Styling will be handled in Story 2.7.

### Tasks / Subtasks
-   [ ] Task 1: Create the file `src/pages/tools/[tool]/[...slug].astro`.
-   [ ] Task 2: Implement the `getStaticPaths` function within the new file.
-   [ ] Task 3: Inside `getStaticPaths`, use `getCollection('tool-articles')` to fetch all articles.
-   [ ] Task 4: Map the results to an array of paths, passing the `entry` to each page via `props`.
-   [ ] Task 5: In the HTML template, retrieve the article `entry` from `Astro.props`.
-   [ ] Task 6: Render `entry.data.title` and the `<Content />` component.
-   [ ] Task 7: Verify that navigating to a URL like `/tools/anki/apa-itu-anki` correctly displays the article's content.

### Dev Notes
This story is the foundation for all subsequent work in this epic. The following architectural and design standards **must** be adhered to in all related stories.

#### Responsive Design Strategy
-   **Mobile-First Approach:** All UI components and layouts must be developed mobile-first. Styles should be written for the smallest breakpoint (`320px`) first, and then use `min-width` media queries to add or adjust styles for larger screens.

#### Breakpoints
-   The following official project breakpoints must be used:
    -   `320px` (Smallest mobile devices)
    -   `640px` (sm, Large mobile / small tablets)
    -   `768px` (md, Tablets)
    -   `1024px` (lg, Laptops/Desktops)
    -   `1280px` (xl, Large desktops)

#### CSS Unit Usage Guide
-   **REM:** This is the **preferred and default unit** for most CSS properties, including `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, and `width`/`height` on containers. It ensures a predictable and scalable design relative to the root font size.
-   **EM:** Use `em` units for properties that need to scale relative to the `font-size` of their direct parent. This is useful for things like the padding on a button or the size of an icon within a text element.
-   **PX:** Use `px` units sparingly and only for properties that require a fixed, non-scalable value. Good use cases include `border-width`, `box-shadow` offsets, or the dimensions of a raster image like a logo.
