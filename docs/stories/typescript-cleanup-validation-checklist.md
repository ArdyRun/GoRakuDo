## Success Criteria Summary

### Primary Success Metrics
- [ ] **0 TypeScript errors/warnings/hints**
- [ ] **Build system 100% functional**
- [ ] **All original functionality preserved**
- [ ] **Performance maintained or improved**
- [ ] **No user-facing regressions**

### Quality Gates
- [ ] All automated tests pass

---

## Emergency Rollback Procedure

If any critical issues are discovered during validation:

1. **Immediate Action**: Stop deployment process
2. **Rollback**: `git revert` to previous commit
3. **Investigation**: Analyze what broke and why
4. **Fix**: Address root cause in separate branch
5. **Retest**: Complete validation checklist again
6. **Redeploy**: Only after all issues resolved

---

## Sign-Off Requirements

### Technical Sign-Off
- [ ] Lead Developer review completed
- [ ] QA testing completed
