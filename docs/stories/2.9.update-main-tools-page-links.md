# Story 2.9: Update Main /tools Page Links

### Status
- **Draft**

### Story
**As a** User,
**I want** to be able to click on a tool from the main `/tools` landing page and be taken directly to its new documentation index page,
**so that** the navigation flow is intuitive and seamless.

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  [ ] The main tools page at `src/pages/tools.astro` is modified.
2.  [ ] The `href` attribute for each tool card in the `tools` data array is updated to point to its corresponding index page (e.g., `/tools/anki`).
3.  [ ] Clicking on the "Anki" card navigates the user to `/tools/anki`.
4.  [ ] Clicking on the "Yomichan" card navigates the user to `/tools/yomitan` (or its correct ID).
5.  [ ] All other tool links are updated accordingly.

### Tasks / Subtasks
-   [ ] Task 1: Open `src/pages/tools.astro` for editing.
-   [ ] Task 2: Locate the `tools` constant, which is an array of tool objects.
-   [ ] Task 3: For each tool object, update the `link` property to the new dynamic path.
    -   Example for Anki: change `link: "/docs/anki-guide"` to `link: "/tools/anki"`.
-   [ ] Task 4: Verify on the live dev server that all links on the `/tools` page are pointing to the correct new index pages.

### Dev Notes
This story is the foundation for all subsequent work in this epic. The following architectural and design standards **must** be adhered to in all related stories.

#### Responsive Design Strategy
-   **Mobile-First Approach:** All UI components and layouts must be developed mobile-first. Styles should be written for the smallest breakpoint (`320px`) first, and then use `min-width` media queries to add or adjust styles for larger screens.

#### Breakpoints
-   The following official project breakpoints must be used:
    -   `320px` (Smallest mobile devices)
    -   `640px` (sm, Large mobile / small tablets)
    -   `768px` (md, Tablets)
    -   `1024px` (lg, Laptops/Desktops)
    -   `1280px` (xl, Large desktops)

#### CSS Unit Usage Guide
-   **REM:** This is the **preferred and default unit** for most CSS properties, including `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, and `width`/`height` on containers. It ensures a predictable and scalable design relative to the root font size.
-   **EM:** Use `em` units for properties that need to scale relative to the `font-size` of their direct parent. This is useful for things like the padding on a button or the size of an icon within a text element.
-   **PX:** Use `px` units sparingly and only for properties that require a fixed, non-scalable value. Good use cases include `border-width`, `box-shadow` offsets, or the dimensions of a raster image like a logo.
