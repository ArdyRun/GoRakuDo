# Story 2.5: Create Dynamic Tool Index Page

### Status
- **Draft**

### Story
**As a** User,
**I want** to see a list of all available articles for a specific tool,
**so that** I can browse all relevant documentation in one place.

### Acceptance Criteria
1.  [ ] A new dynamic route file is created at `src/pages/tools/[tool]/index.astro`.
2.  [ ] The page uses `getStaticPaths` to generate an index page for each tool category (e.g., `/tools/anki`, `/tools/yomitan`).
3.  [ ] The page fetches all articles that belong to the current tool's category (based on its parent folder).
4.  [ ] It displays an unstyled list of the articles' titles.
5.  [ ] Each title is a link pointing to the correct article page.
6.  [ ] Styling will be handled in Story 2.8.

### Tasks / Subtasks
-   [ ] Task 1: Create the file `src/pages/tools/[tool]/index.astro`.
-   [ ] Task 2: Implement `getStaticPaths` to generate paths for each sub-directory in `src/content/tools/`.
-   [ ] Task 3: In the main component, get the `tool` parameter from `Astro.params`.
-   [ ] Task 4: Fetch all articles from the collection using `getCollection('tool-articles')`.
-   [ ] Task 5: Filter the articles to only include those whose `slug` starts with the current `tool` parameter.
-   [ ] Task 6: Render an `<ul>` of the filtered articles.
-   [ ] Task 7: For each article, render an `<li>` with an `<a>` tag linking to its `slug`.

### Dev Notes
This story is the foundation for all subsequent work in this epic. The following architectural and design standards **must** be adhered to in all related stories.

#### Responsive Design Strategy
-   **Mobile-First Approach:** All UI components and layouts must be developed mobile-first. Styles should be written for the smallest breakpoint (`320px`) first, and then use `min-width` media queries to add or adjust styles for larger screens.

#### Breakpoints
-   The following official project breakpoints must be used:
    -   `320px` (Smallest mobile devices)
    -   `640px` (sm, Large mobile / small tablets)
    -   `768px` (md, Tablets)
    -   `1024px` (lg, Laptops/Desktops)
    -   `1280px` (xl, Large desktops)

#### CSS Unit Usage Guide
-   **REM:** This is the **preferred and default unit** for most CSS properties, including `font-size`, `margin`, `padding`, and `width`/`height` on containers. It ensures a predictable and scalable design relative to the root font size.
-   **EM:** Use `em` units for properties that need to scale relative to the `font-size` of their direct parent. This is useful for things like the padding on a button or the size of an icon within a text element.
-   **PX:** Use `px` units sparingly and only for properties that require a fixed, non-scalable value. Good use cases include `border-width`, `box-shadow` offsets, or the dimensions of a raster image like a logo.
