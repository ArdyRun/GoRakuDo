## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. PERF-001: Animation Performance Degradation
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Complex animations with canvas rendering and multiple simultaneous effects
**Impact**: High (3) - Could cause frame drops, memory leaks, and poor user experience

**Description**: Multiple animation systems (waves, stars, page transitions, scroll effects) running simultaneously without performance monitoring could degrade user experience significantly.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement real-time FPS monitoring with `requestAnimationFrame` profiling
- Create device capability detection for screen size, GPU capabilities, and battery status
- Establish hard performance budgets (60fps desktop, 30fps mobile, <100MB memory)
- Set up performance alerts that block deployment if thresholds exceeded

**Testing Focus**: Real device testing, memory profiling, battery impact assessment

### 2. TECH-002: CSS Migration Complexity
**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Complex existing CSS with heavy custom styles
**Impact**: High (3) - Migration could break existing functionality and impact bundle size

**Description**: Story requires migrating from heavy custom CSS to Tailwind v4.1 with potential for breaking changes and bundle size impact.

**Mitigation**:
- Complete CSS audit documenting every class and its usage
- Implement feature flag system for gradual rollout with instant rollback capability
- Create comprehensive migration testing plan with visual regression testing
- Set up continuous bundle size monitoring throughout migration

**Testing Focus**: Visual regression testing, bundle analysis, functionality preservation validation

## High Priority Risks (Score 6)

### 3. PERF-003: Bundle Size Impact
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Tailwind optimization could increase initial bundle
**Impact**: High (3) - Could impact page load performance and Core Web Vitals

**Description**: CSS optimization and Tailwind migration may temporarily increase bundle size before optimization benefits are realized.

**Mitigation**:
- Establish bundle size baselines before migration begins
- Implement progressive loading and code splitting strategies
- Monitor Lighthouse performance scores throughout development
- Set up automated bundle size alerts with rollback triggers

### 4. TECH-005: Animation Conflict Prevention
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Multiple animation systems could interfere
**Impact**: High (3) - Could cause visual glitches and performance issues

**Description**: Coordinating wave animations, star field, page transitions, and micro-interactions without conflicts.

**Mitigation**:
- Create animation prioritization system with resource management
- Implement proper cleanup procedures for animation event listeners
- Use requestAnimationFrame with frame rate limiting instead of throttling
- Coordinate timing to prevent overlapping resource-intensive animations

### 5. OPS-004: Cross-Browser Compatibility
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: High (3) - Animation features may behave differently across browsers
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Could affect user experience consistency

**Description**: Ensuring smooth animations work consistently across Chrome, Firefox, Safari, and Edge.

**Mitigation**:
- Test on actual devices, not just emulators
- Implement progressive enhancement for unsupported features
- Create browser-specific optimizations where needed
- Validate animation behavior across all target browsers

### 6. SEC-006: CSS Injection Vulnerabilities
**Score: 6 (High)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Dynamic CSS class generation could introduce vulnerabilities
**Impact**: High (3) - Could lead to XSS attacks through CSS injection

**Description**: Dynamic Tailwind class generation and CSS manipulation could introduce security vulnerabilities.

**Mitigation**:
- Sanitize all dynamic class names and Tailwind utilities
- Implement CSP headers for additional protection
- Use predefined class sets instead of dynamic generation
- Regular security audits of CSS and animation code

## Medium Priority Risks (Score 4)

### 7. PERF-008: Memory Leak Prevention
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Canvas animations and event listeners could cause leaks
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Could degrade performance over time

**Description**: Canvas-based animations and multiple event listeners could cause memory leaks if not properly managed.

**Mitigation**:
- Implement proper cleanup procedures for canvas operations
- Use WeakMap/WeakSet for event listener management
- Regular memory leak testing and profiling
- Animation cleanup on component unmount

### 8. OPS-007: Rollback Complexity
**Score: 4 (Medium)**
**Probability**: Medium (2) - Complex animation system could complicate rollbacks
**Impact**: Medium (2) - Could extend incident response time

**Description**: Complex animation system with multiple components could complicate rollback procedures.

**Mitigation**:
- Document and test rollback process for each migration step
- Implement feature flags for all major animation features
- Create automated rollback scripts
- Test rollback procedures in staging environment
