Reviewer: Quinn (Test Architect)

## Executive Summary

- Total Risks Identified: 8
- Critical Risks: 1
- High Risks: 2
- Medium Risks: 3
- Low Risks: 2
- Risk Score: 67/100 (calculated)

## Critical Risks Requiring Immediate Attention

### 1. SEC-001: Path Traversal Vulnerability in Dynamic Routing

**Score: 9 (Critical)**
**Probability**: High - Dynamic route parameters directly used in file system operations
**Impact**: High - Potential unauthorized access to system files, information disclosure
**Mitigation**:
- Implement strict input validation for tool and slug parameters
- Use whitelist approach for tool names
- Add path traversal detection patterns (`..`, `//`)
- Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
**Testing Focus**: Security testing with malicious URL patterns, penetration testing of route parameters

## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

- **Security Testing**: URL parameter injection tests, path traversal attempts
- **Penetration Testing**: Dynamic route security validation
- **Test Data**: Malicious URL patterns, invalid tool names, special characters

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

- **Performance Testing**: Build time measurement with large collections
- **Load Testing**: Bundle size analysis for multiple dynamic routes
- **Integration Testing**: Content collection integration with routing

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

- **Functional Testing**: Standard article rendering and navigation
- **Regression Testing**: Existing functionality preservation
- **Error Handling**: Graceful degradation and user experience

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All critical risks (score 9) - Path traversal vulnerability
- High risks affecting security - XSS vulnerability

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with compensating controls - Performance monitoring, error handling
- Low risks with monitoring in place - Content validation, rendering checks

### Accepted Risks

- Performance risks with acceptable thresholds documented
- Technical complexity risks with proper testing coverage

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- **Security Metrics**: Failed route access attempts, suspicious URL patterns
- **Performance Metrics**: Build times, bundle sizes, page load times
- **Error Rates**: 404 redirects, content rendering failures
- **Content Metrics**: Article accessibility, URL structure validation

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New tool types added to content collection
- Dynamic routing patterns change
- Security vulnerabilities discovered in similar implementations
- Performance issues reported with large content collections
- Content schema modifications

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### SEC-001: Path Traversal Vulnerability
**Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:
- Implement input validation library for route parameters
- Add path traversal detection patterns
- Use whitelist approach for tool names
- Implement proper error handling without information disclosure
**Testing Requirements**: Security testing with OWASP ZAP, manual penetration testing
**Residual Risk**: Low - Some zero-day vulnerabilities may remain
**Owner**: Development Team
**Timeline**: Before deployment

### SEC-002: XSS through URL Parameter Injection
**Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:
- Sanitize all URL parameters before use
- Implement CSP headers
- Validate and escape output in templates
- Use safe routing patterns
**Testing Requirements**: XSS testing tools, manual security review
**Residual Risk**: Low - Comprehensive input validation implemented
**Owner**: Development Team
**Timeline**: Before deployment

### PERF-001: Build Time Degradation
**Strategy**: Detective
**Actions**:
- Implement build time monitoring
- Optimize getStaticPaths implementation
- Use incremental builds where possible
- Monitor bundle size increases
**Testing Requirements**: Performance testing, build time measurement
**Residual Risk**: Medium - Acceptable thresholds defined
**Owner**: Development Team
**Timeline**: Continuous monitoring

## Quality Gate Impact

Based on risk profile:
- **Gate Decision**: CONCERNS (due to high-risk security issues)
- **Required Actions**: Implement security mitigations before production
- **Monitoring**: Enhanced security and performance monitoring required
- **Risk Acceptance**: Document any accepted risks with business justification
