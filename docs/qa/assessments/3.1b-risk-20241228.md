## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: Critical Risk Tests

*No critical risks identified*

### Priority 2: High Risk Tests

*No high risks identified*

### Priority 3: Medium/Low Risk Tests

#### TECH-001: Accidental Modification Risk
**Mitigation Strategy: Preventive**
- **Actions:**
  - Use precise line targeting (423-449 only)
  - Create SearchEngine.ts.backup before changes
  - Verify method signature matches exactly
  - Confirm zero references before removal
- **Testing Focus:**
  - Unit: Verify only target method removed
  - Integration: Confirm search functionality intact
  - E2E: Validate search results accuracy

#### TECH-002: Incomplete Removal Risk
**Mitigation Strategy: Preventive**
- **Actions:**
  - Remove complete method body (27 lines)
  - Clean up any trailing whitespace
  - Verify TypeScript compilation success
  - Confirm exact warning reduction (44→43)
- **Testing Focus:**
  - Unit: Syntax validation with `npx astro check`
  - Build: Successful `npm run build` execution
  - Integration: No runtime errors during search

#### PERF-001: Performance Regression Risk
**Mitigation Strategy: Detective**
- **Actions:**
  - Benchmark search response times before/after
  - Measure bundle size reduction
  - Monitor for any performance degradation
  - Validate search accuracy maintained
- **Testing Focus:**
  - Performance: Response time benchmarks
  - Bundle: Size reduction verification
  - Accuracy: Search result quality validation

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

*No critical or high risks identified*

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- All identified risks have clear mitigation strategies
- Backup file provides rollback capability
- Comprehensive testing protocol covers all risk areas

### Accepted Risks

- **TECH-001 & TECH-002**: Accepted with backup strategy and precise targeting
- **PERF-001**: Accepted with performance benchmarking and monitoring

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- Search response times (PERF-001)
- TypeScript warning count stability (TECH-002)
- Search functionality accuracy (TECH-001)
- Bundle size optimization confirmation

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- Search performance issues reported
- TypeScript warnings increase unexpectedly
- Search functionality regressions detected
- Bundle size optimization targets not met

## Risk Mitigation Summary

### Preventive Controls
- **Precise Targeting**: Exact line removal (423-449)
- **Backup Strategy**: SearchEngine.ts.backup creation
- **Reference Validation**: Comprehensive grep analysis confirmation

### Detective Controls
- **TypeScript Validation**: `npx astro check` warning count verification
- **Build Verification**: `npm run build` success confirmation
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Before/after response time measurement

### Corrective Controls
- **Rollback Capability**: Git revert + backup restoration
- **Incremental Validation**: Step-by-step testing protocol
- **Scope Protection**: Zero modifications to forbidden components

## Overall Risk Assessment

**Story 3.1B presents MINIMAL RISK** due to:

1. **Targeted Scope**: Single unused method removal (27 lines)
2. **Zero Dependencies**: Method has no references in codebase
3. **Clear Validation**: Measurable success criteria (44→43 warnings)
4. **Backup Strategy**: Complete rollback capability available
5. **Isolated Impact**: No other components affected

**Recommendation: PROCEED WITH IMPLEMENTATION** using defined mitigation strategies and testing protocol.
