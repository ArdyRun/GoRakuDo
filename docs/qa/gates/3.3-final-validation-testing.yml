review_date: "2024-12-29"
reviewer: "Quinn (Test Architect)"
gate_decision: "FAIL"
rationale: "Story contains 3 critical risks (score 9) requiring immediate mitigation: Build system integration failures, performance degradation potential, and incomplete functional test coverage. Cannot proceed to production without addressing these high-impact risks that could prevent deployment or cause significant user experience issues."

  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "Establish pre-cleanup performance and build baselines"
      - "Implement automated build validation with rollback capabilities"
      - "Create comprehensive test scenarios matrix for critical paths"
      - "Implement performance regression testing for Core Web Vitals"
      - "Add automated smoke tests for AI content processing pipeline"
    monitor:
      - "Monitor Core Web Vitals (LCP < 2s, FID < 75ms, CLS < 0.1)"
      - "Track build times and bundle size changes"
      - "Monitor AI content processing accuracy and response times"
      - "Validate search functionality with real user query patterns"
      - "Track error rates across Vue/Astro component integrations"

notes: |
  This is a high-stakes validation story following major TypeScript cleanup across AI content processing,
  search engine, and utility functions. While systematic testing approach is solid, the complexity
  of changes and manual testing reliance create elevated risk profile.

  Key focus areas:
  - TypeScript compilation must pass with zero errors/warnings
  - Content processing pipeline integrity is critical for site functionality
  - Performance regression testing essential given AI integration complexity
  - Cross-browser testing should not be overlooked despite low individual risk

  Recommendation: Consider automated integration tests for content pipeline before production deployment.
