summary: |
  ðŸš¨ CRITICAL BLOCKERS IDENTIFIED - Story cannot proceed without addressing:
  ðŸ”¥ PERF-001: FPS monitoring system and device detection must be implemented first
  ðŸ”¥ TECH-002: CSS audit and feature flag system must be completed before migration
  Risk assessment completed for Story 1.3. Medium-High risk level identified
  with 1 critical risk and 2 high risks requiring mitigation before implementation
  can proceed. Performance optimization and Tailwind migration carry the highest
  technical risks.

overall_assessment: |
  Medium-High Risk - Story is feasible but requires careful attention to performance
  optimization and thorough testing across all target environments. Critical focus
  on animation performance (60fps requirement) and Tailwind migration complexity.
  All risks are mitigable with proper planning and testing.
