# Epic: Expand @tools Page for Immersion Tool Documentation

**Epic ID:** 2.0  
**Created:** December 19, 2024  
**Last Updated:** December 19, 2024  
**Status:** In Progress (1/10 stories completed)

## 1. Project Analysis

**Existing Project Context:**

-   [x] **Project purpose and current functionality understood:** The project is a website `GoRakuDo` built with Astro. The `/tools` page currently serves as a simple landing page listing various tools for Japanese immersion learning, with links to external or placeholder pages.
-   [x] **Existing technology stack identified:** Astro, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, Markdown (MDX potentially available).
-   [x] **Current architecture patterns noted:** The site uses Astro for static site generation, with component-based UI (`.astro`, `.vue`). Content is managed in Markdown files. Dynamic routing is available through Astro's file-based routing system.
-   [x] **Integration points with existing system identified:** The new features will integrate with Astro's content collection system and its dynamic page generation capabilities. It will extend the existing `/tools` route.

**Enhancement Scope:**

-   [x] **Enhancement clearly defined and scoped:** The goal is to transform the `/tools` page into a full-fledged documentation hub. This involves creating a new content collection for tool articles, building dynamic index pages for each tool category (e.g., `/tools/anki`), and generating individual article pages from Markdown files (e.g., `/tools/anki/getting-started`). A tagging system will be implemented to allow articles to span multiple tool categories.
-   [x] **Impact on existing functionality assessed:** The primary impact is on the `/tools` page, which will now link to the new index pages instead of placeholder pages. The core functionality of the rest of the site remains unaffected.
-   [x] **Required integration points identified:**
    -   Astro Content Collections (`src/content/config.ts`).
    -   Astro dynamic routing (`src/pages/tools/[tool]/index.astro`, `src/pages/tools/[tool]/[...slug].astro`).
    -   Modification of `src/pages/tools.astro` to update links.
-   [x] **Success criteria established:**
    -   Users can successfully navigate from the main `/tools` page to category-specific index pages.
    -   Tool index pages correctly list all articles associated with that tool via directory structure and tags.
    -   Individual article pages render Markdown content correctly with appropriate styling.
    -   URLs adhere to the `http://localhost:4321/tools/{tools-id}/{post-title-url}` structure.
    -   Content within `src/content/tools/` is isolated from the `/docs` section of the site.
    -   A breadcrumb navigation system is in place for usability.

## 2. Epic Creation

#### Epic Title

Expand `@tools` Page for Immersion Tool Documentation - Brownfield Enhancement

#### Epic Goal

To evolve the `/tools` page from a simple list into a comprehensive and dynamic documentation hub for Japanese immersion tools. This will provide significant value to users by offering structured, in-depth guides and tutorials, thereby increasing user engagement and establishing the site as an authoritative resource in this niche.

#### Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

-   **Current relevant functionality:** The `src/pages/tools.astro` page displays a static grid of tools with brief descriptions. It is built with Astro and styled with Tailwind CSS.
-   **Technology stack:** Astro, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS. Content is sourced from Markdown files.
-   **Integration points:** The new functionality will hook into the Astro content collection API and the file-based dynamic routing system.

**Enhancement Details:**

-   **What's being added/changed:** We are adding a new, scalable documentation system powered by Astro Content Collections. This includes:
    1.  A new "tool-articles" content collection.
    2.  Dynamic index pages for each tool to list relevant articles.
    3.  Dynamic pages to render the full content of each article.
    4.  A tagging mechanism within the frontmatter of the articles to create relationships between them and the tool categories.
-   **How it integrates:**
    1.  A schema will be defined in `src/content/config.ts`.
    2.  Markdown files will be organized in `src/content/tools/{tool-name}/`.
    3.  Two new dynamic routes will be created: `src/pages/tools/[tool]/index.astro` and `src/pages/tools/[tool]/[...slug].astro`.
    4.  The `getCollection` API from Astro will be used to fetch and filter the articles based on the tool category and tags.
-   **Success criteria:** All success criteria from the "Project Analysis" section are met.

#### Stories

Here is the detailed 10-story breakdown to ensure a smooth, incremental implementation:

1.  **Story 2.1: Define Content Collection Schema:** ✅ **COMPLETED** - Define the `tool-articles` schema in `src/content/config.ts` with all required fields (`title`, `description`, `tags`, `publishedDate`, `heroImage`, etc.).
2.  **Story 2.2: Create Content Directory Structure:** Create the necessary directory structure under `src/content/tools/` for different tools (e.g., `anki`, `yomitan`).
3.  **Story 2.3: Migrate Existing 'Anki' Content:** Move the existing `apa-itu-anki.md` file into `src/content/tools/anki/` and update its frontmatter to match the new schema.
4.  **Story 2.4: Create Dynamic Article Page Layout:** Create the basic dynamic page for rendering a single article at `src/pages/tools/[tool]/[...slug].astro`. This initial version will focus on rendering the Markdown body.
5.  **Story 2.5: Create Dynamic Tool Index Page:** Create the dynamic index page at `src/pages/tools/[tool]/index.astro` that lists all articles for a given tool (e.g., all articles in `src/content/tools/anki/`).
6.  **Story 2.6: Implement Tagging System Logic:** Enhance the tool index page to filter and display articles based on tags, allowing an article to appear in multiple tool indexes.
7.  **Story 2.7: Style the Article Page:** Apply styling to the article page to match the website's design, including typography, code blocks, and images.
8.  **Story 2.8: Style the Tool Index Page:** Apply styling to the tool index page, creating a card grid or list view for the articles that is consistent with the site's aesthetic.
9.  **Story 2.9: Update Main `/tools` Page Links:** Modify `src/pages/tools.astro` to update the links on the tool cards to point to their new index pages (e.g., `/tools/anki`).
10. **Story 2.10: Implement Breadcrumb Navigation:** Add a breadcrumb component to the tool index and article pages for improved user navigation (e.g., `Home > Tools > Anki > Getting Started`).

#### Epic Progress Summary

**Current Status:** Foundation Phase - 1 of 10 stories completed (10%)

**Completed Stories:**
- ✅ **Story 2.1:** Content Collection Schema - **COMPLETED** on December 19, 2024
  - New `tool-articles` collection schema defined with Zod validation
  - All acceptance criteria met and QA review passed (Gate: PASS)
  - Build process validated successfully
  - Foundation established for subsequent stories

**Next Priority:** Story 2.2 - Create Content Directory Structure
- This story will build upon the completed schema to establish the organizational structure
- Will create directories for different tools (anki, yomitan, migaku)
- Prerequisites: Story 2.1 ✅ (Completed)

**Risk Assessment:** Low - Foundation successfully established with comprehensive QA validation

#### Compatibility Requirements

-   [x] Existing APIs remain unchanged.
-   [x] Database schema changes are backward compatible (Not applicable, file-based).
-   [x] UI changes follow existing patterns and design system.
-   [x] Performance impact is minimal; new pages will be statically generated.

#### Risk Mitigation

-   **Primary Risk:** Misconfiguration of Astro's content collections or dynamic routes could result in build errors, broken links, or content not being displayed correctly. The complexity of the tagging logic could also introduce bugs.
-   **Mitigation:** We will follow a story-by-story implementation, ensuring each piece of functionality is working before moving to the next. We will start with a single tool (Anki) as a proof-of-concept. Automated tests could be added to verify routes and content rendering.
-   **Rollback Plan:** All changes will be managed in a dedicated feature branch in Git. If a story introduces a critical issue, the specific commit can be reverted. The entire feature can be withheld from merging to `main` until fully functional.
