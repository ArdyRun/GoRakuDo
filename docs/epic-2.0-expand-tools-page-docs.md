# Epic: Expand @tools Page for Immersion Tool Documentation

**Epic ID:** 2.0  
**Created:** December 19, 2024  
**Last Updated:** January 27, 2025  
**Status:** In Progress (4/10 stories completed)

## 1. Project Analysis

**Existing Project Context:**

-   [x] **Project purpose and current functionality understood:** The project is a website `GoRakuDo` built with Astro. The `/tools` page currently serves as a simple landing page listing various tools for Japanese immersion learning, with links to external or placeholder pages.
-   [x] **Existing technology stack identified:** Astro, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS, Markdown (MDX potentially available).
-   [x] **Current architecture patterns noted:** The site uses Astro for static site generation, with component-based UI (`.astro`, `.vue`). Content is managed in Markdown files. Dynamic routing is available through Astro's file-based routing system.
-   [x] **Integration points with existing system identified:** The new features will integrate with Astro's content collection system and its dynamic page generation capabilities. It will extend the existing `/tools` route.

**Enhancement Scope:**

-   [x] **Enhancement clearly defined and scoped:** The goal is to transform the `/tools` page into a full-fledged documentation hub. This involves creating a new content collection for tool articles, building dynamic index pages for each tool category (e.g., `/tools/anki`), and generating individual article pages from Markdown files (e.g., `/tools/anki/getting-started`). A tagging system will be implemented to allow articles to span multiple tool categories.
-   [x] **Impact on existing functionality assessed:** The primary impact is on the `/tools` page, which will now link to the new index pages instead of placeholder pages. The core functionality of the rest of the site remains unaffected.
-   [x] **Required integration points identified:**
    -   Astro Content Collections (`src/content/config.ts`).
    -   Astro dynamic routing (`src/pages/tools/[tool]/index.astro`, `src/pages/tools/[tool]/[...slug].astro`).
    -   Modification of `src/pages/tools.astro` to update links.
-   [x] **Success criteria established:**
    -   Users can successfully navigate from the main `/tools` page to category-specific index pages.
    -   Tool index pages correctly list all articles associated with that tool via directory structure and tags.
    -   Individual article pages render Markdown content correctly with appropriate styling.
    -   URLs adhere to the `http://localhost:4321/tools/{tools-id}/{post-title-url}` structure.
    -   Content within `src/content/tools/` is isolated from the `/docs` section of the site.
    -   A breadcrumb navigation system is in place for usability.

## 2. Epic Creation

#### Epic Title

Expand `@tools` Page for Immersion Tool Documentation - Brownfield Enhancement

#### Epic Goal

To evolve the `/tools` page from a simple list into a comprehensive and dynamic documentation hub for Japanese immersion tools. This will provide significant value to users by offering structured, in-depth guides and tutorials, thereby increasing user engagement and establishing the site as an authoritative resource in this niche.

#### Epic Description

**Existing System Context:**

-   **Current relevant functionality:** The `src/pages/tools.astro` page displays a static grid of tools with brief descriptions. It is built with Astro and styled with Tailwind CSS.
-   **Technology stack:** Astro, Vue.js, Tailwind CSS. Content is sourced from Markdown files.
-   **Integration points:** The new functionality will hook into the Astro content collection API and the file-based dynamic routing system.

**Enhancement Details:**

-   **What's being added/changed:** We are adding a new, scalable documentation system powered by Astro Content Collections. This includes:
    1.  A new "tool-articles" content collection.
    2.  Dynamic index pages for each tool to list relevant articles.
    3.  Dynamic pages to render the full content of each article.
    4.  A tagging mechanism within the frontmatter of the articles to create relationships between them and the tool categories.
-   **How it integrates:**
    1.  A schema will be defined in `src/content/config.ts`.
    2.  Markdown files will be organized in `src/content/tool-articles/{tool-name}/`.
    3.  Two new dynamic routes will be created: `src/pages/tools/[tool]/index.astro` and `src/pages/tools/[tool]/[...slug].astro`.
    4.  The `getCollection` API from Astro will be used to fetch and filter the articles based on the tool category and tags.
-   **Success criteria:** All success criteria from the "Project Analysis" section are met.

#### Stories

Here is the detailed 10-story breakdown to ensure a smooth, incremental implementation:

1.  **Story 2.1: Define Content Collection Schema:** âœ… **COMPLETED** - Define the `tool-articles` schema in `src/content/config.ts` with all required fields (`title`, `description`, `tags`, `publishedDate`, `heroImage`, etc.).
2.  **Story 2.2: Create Content Directory Structure:** âœ… **COMPLETED** - Create the necessary directory structure under `src/content/tool-articles/` for different tools (e.g., `anki`, `yomitan`).
3.  **Story 2.3: Validate Existing 'Anki' Content Schema Compliance:** âœ… **COMPLETED** - Verify that the existing `apa-itu-anki.md` file in `src/content/tool-articles/anki/` conforms to the established schema and build process.
4.  **Story 2.4: Create Dynamic Article Page Layout:** âœ… **COMPLETED** - Create the basic dynamic page for rendering a single article at `src/pages/tools/[tool]/[...slug].astro`. This initial version will focus on rendering the Markdown body.
