- Bundle size targets cannot be achieved
- User feedback indicates performance problems

## Recommendations

### Immediate Actions Required
1. **Implement Performance Monitoring**: Set up FPS monitoring and performance budgets
2. **Conduct CSS Audit**: Document current CSS usage before Tailwind migration
3. **Establish Baselines**: Measure current performance metrics before changes

### Testing Focus Areas
1. **Performance Testing**: Prioritize animation performance on low-end devices
2. **Visual Regression**: Ensure no layout shifts during CSS migration
3. **Cross-Browser Testing**: Validate animations across all supported browsers

### Risk Mitigation Priority
1. **Critical**: PERF-001 (Animation Performance) - Requires immediate attention
