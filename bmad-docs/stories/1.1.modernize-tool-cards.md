## Dev Notes

### Relevant Source Tree Info
- `src/pages/tools.astro` - Main tools page with card grid layout
- `src/styles/tools/tools.css` - Current tools page styling
- `src/styles/global.css` - Global styles and CSS variables
- Vue components: `src/components/public-components/Navbar.vue`

### Current Implementation Details
- Tools data is defined in the Astro component frontmatter
- Cards use CSS Grid layout with responsive breakpoints
- Existing wave and stars animations are implemented in JavaScript
- Current color scheme uses CSS custom properties (--clr-accent, etc.)
- Cards have basic hover effects and transitions
- Heavy custom CSS with limited Tailwind v4.1 integration
- Monolithic HTML structure that could be more modular
- Good semantic structure but needs enhanced accessibility

### Development Approach Strategy
**Two-Phase Implementation:**
1. **Phase 1-5: Normal CSS Implementation** - Build all features with clean, semantic CSS first
2. **Phase 6: Gradual Tailwind Migration** - Convert one component at a time to Tailwind v4.1 utilities

**Benefits of This Approach:**
- **Faster Development**: No need to learn Tailwind utilities during initial development
- **Better Debugging**: Easier to debug CSS issues with normal CSS
- **Incremental Migration**: Can test each component after Tailwind conversion
- **Fallback Safety**: Can revert individual components if Tailwind conversion causes issues
- **Learning Opportunity**: Team can learn Tailwind gradually while building features

### UX Expert Recommendations for Implementation
- **Visual Design**: Implement modern card hierarchy with clean CSS first, then migrate to Tailwind v4.1 utilities
- **Accessibility**: Enhanced ARIA labeling and semantic markup structure
- **Mobile Experience**: 44px minimum touch targets for mobile accessibility
- **Keyboard Navigation**: Clear focus indicators and logical tab order
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with specific breakpoints (360px, 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px)
- **Development Strategy**: Build with normal CSS first, then gradually convert to Tailwind for maintainability
- **Future Enhancements**: Card sorting/filtering and advanced interactions planned for separate stories

### Comprehensive UX Specification
- **Target User Personas**: Beginners, Intermediate, Advanced learners, and Tool Researchers
- **Design Principles**: Clarity over cleverness, progressive disclosure, consistent patterns, immediate feedback
- **Color Palette**: Primary (#6366f1), Secondary (#8b5cf6), Accent (#06b6d4), Success (#10b981), Warning (#f59e0b), Error (#ef4444)
- **Typography**: Inter font family with specific type scale (H1: 48px, H2: 36px, H3: 24px, Body: 16px, Small: 14px)
- **Iconography**: Lucide React icons with semantic meaning and proper alt text
- **Spacing**: Tailwind v4.1 spacing scale with 4px base unit
- **Animation**: 60fps animations with purposeful motion and accessibility awareness
- **Performance Goals**: Page load under 2s, interaction response under 100ms

### Testing Standards
- Test file location: No specific test files required for UI changes
- Test standards: Manual visual testing and accessibility validation
- Testing frameworks: Browser dev tools, Lighthouse accessibility audit
- Specific requirements: Verify all existing animations continue working

**Phase 1-5 Testing (Normal CSS):**
- CSS validation and cross-browser compatibility
- Touch target size validation (44px minimum)
- Keyboard navigation testing with focus indicators
- Screen reader compatibility testing
- Responsive breakpoint testing at 360px, 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px
- Mobile-first approach validation (min-width media queries)

**Phase 6 Testing (Tailwind Migration):**
- Tailwind v4.1 utility validation and responsive breakpoint testing
- Verify all functionality works after Tailwind conversion
- Performance testing to ensure Tailwind doesn't impact load times
- Accessibility testing after utility class conversion
