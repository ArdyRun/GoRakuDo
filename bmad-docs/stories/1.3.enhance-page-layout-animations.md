## ðŸš« PROTECTED AREAS - DO NOT MODIFY

### **HTML Structure Protection**
**DO NOT CHANGE** the following HTML elements and attributes in `src/pages/tools.astro`:

1. **Core Page Structure**:
   - `<html>`, `<head>`, `<body>` tags and their attributes
   - `<title>` and meta tags (SEO preservation)
   - `<main>` content wrapper structure
   - `<header>` and `<footer>` sections

2. **Content Integrity**:
   - All text content, headings, and descriptions
   - Tool card content and descriptions
   - Navigation links and their href attributes
   - Form elements and their functionality
   - Accessibility attributes (aria-* attributes)

3. **Astro-Specific Elements**:
   - `transition:name` attributes (view transitions)
   - `client:*` directives for Vue components
   - Astro component imports and usage
   - Layout component structure

### **CSS Protection Zones**
**DO NOT MODIFY** the following CSS areas in `src/styles/tools/tools.css`:

1. **Core Functionality Styles**:
   - Tool card hover and focus states (until migration is complete)
   - Animation keyframes for micro-interactions
   - Accessibility focus indicators
   - Critical responsive breakpoints (360px, 640px, 768px, 1024px, 1280px)

2. **Global CSS Variables** in `src/styles/global.css`:
   - GoRakuDo color palette (`--clr-accent`, `--clr-accent-glow`)
   - CSS custom properties for consistent theming
   - Global animation timings and easing functions
   - Accessibility and responsive utilities

3. **Protected Until Migration Complete**:
   - All existing CSS classes until CSS audit is finished
   - Bundle size until monitoring is established
   - Visual hierarchy until regression testing is set up

### **JavaScript/TypeScript Protection**
**DO NOT MODIFY** the following JavaScript areas:

1. **Core Animation Systems**:
   - `src/scripts/ui/background-animations/stars-animation.js` - Stars animation module
   - Wave animation implementation in tools.astro
   - Canvas rendering logic and performance optimizations
   - `requestAnimationFrame` implementations

2. **Integration Points**:
   - `src/components/Navbar.vue` - Navigation functionality
   - `src/layouts/BaseLayout.astro` - Page structure and SEO
   - Intersection Observer implementations for loading states
   - Event listener management systems

3. **Configuration Files**:
   - `tailwind.config.mjs` - Utility configuration
   - `astro.config.mjs` - Build optimization settings
   - `tsconfig.json` - TypeScript configuration

### **Critical Protection Rules**

1. **Performance Monitoring First**: Do not modify any animation or CSS until performance monitoring systems are established
2. **Feature Flag Requirement**: All CSS changes must be behind feature flags until migration is complete
3. **Baseline Preservation**: Do not change anything until current performance baselines are recorded
4. **Rollback Capability**: All changes must have documented rollback procedures
5. **Visual Regression**: No layout changes without visual regression testing baseline

### **What CAN Be Modified (After Protection Setup)**

1. **Performance Optimization**: Frame rate capping, memory management, device detection
2. **CSS Migration**: Gradual Tailwind migration with feature flags
3. **Animation Enhancement**: Performance improvements to existing animations
4. **Layout Spacing**: Visual hierarchy improvements using Tailwind utilities
5. **Loading States**: Enhanced loading feedback and transitions

### **Implementation Order Protection**

**MUST FOLLOW THIS SEQUENCE**:
1. âœ… Complete Performance Monitoring Setup (PERF-001)
2. âœ… Complete CSS Audit and Migration Preparation (TECH-002)
3. âœ… Establish all baselines and testing frameworks
4. âœ… Implement feature flag system
5. ðŸ”„ **THEN** begin actual modifications

**Violation of these protection rules will result in immediate rollback and may block production deployment.**
