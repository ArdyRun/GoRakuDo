## Risk-Based Testing Strategy

### Priority 1: High Risk Tests

- **TECH-001**: Comprehensive integration testing of AI content processing pipeline
- End-to-end testing of content analysis features
- Mind map integration functionality verification
- API contract validation

### Priority 2: Medium Risk Tests

- **TECH-002**: TypeScript compilation testing with strict mode
- Interface compatibility testing across modules
- **TECH-003**: Import resolution testing in different build configurations

### Priority 3: Low Risk Tests

- Standard functional regression testing
- Build system verification
- Performance baseline comparison

## Risk Mitigation Strategies

### TECH-001: Breaking Functionality
**Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:
- Create comprehensive test suite before cleanup
- Implement feature flags for risky changes
- Use incremental cleanup approach (file-by-file)
- Maintain git branches for each file cleanup

**Testing Requirements**:
- Automated test suite execution
- Manual functional testing of AI features
- Integration testing of content pipeline

**Residual Risk**: Low - Comprehensive testing coverage
**Owner**: Development Team
**Timeline**: Before each file cleanup

### TECH-002: TypeScript Interface Changes
**Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:
- Review all exported interfaces before modification
- Maintain backward compatibility where possible
- Document any breaking changes clearly
- Use TypeScript strict mode during development

**Testing Requirements**:
- `npx astro check` execution after each change
- Interface compatibility testing
- Build verification

**Residual Risk**: Low - TypeScript compiler will catch issues
**Owner**: Development Team
**Timeline**: During development

### TECH-003: Import Dependency Disruption
**Strategy**: Preventive
**Actions**:
- Map import dependencies before cleanup
- Test import resolution in different environments
- Verify bundle analysis after changes
- Maintain explicit import paths where needed

**Testing Requirements**:
- Build system testing
- Bundle analysis verification
- Import resolution testing

**Residual Risk**: Low - Build system will fail if issues exist
**Owner**: Development Team
**Timeline**: During development

## Risk Acceptance Criteria

### Must Fix Before Production

- All high risks (score 6) - TECH-001
- Any breaking functionality issues
- TypeScript compilation errors

### Can Deploy with Mitigation

- Medium risks with comprehensive testing
- Low risks with monitoring in place

### Accepted Risks

- Performance impact from bundle changes (PERF-001)
- Development velocity impact (BUS-001)

## Monitoring Requirements

Post-deployment monitoring for:

- TypeScript warning count reduction
- Build success rate
- AI content processing performance
- Bundle size metrics
- Runtime error rates

## Risk Review Triggers

Review and update risk profile when:

- New TypeScript warnings are introduced
- Build system configuration changes
- AI content processing pipeline modifications
- Performance degradation is reported
- Integration issues are discovered

## Recommendations

### Testing Priority
1. Focus on integration testing of AI content features
2. Implement automated TypeScript checking
3. Maintain comprehensive test coverage

### Development Focus
1. Use incremental cleanup approach
2. Maintain git branches for each file
3. Document all interface changes

### Deployment Strategy
1. Deploy changes incrementally
2. Use feature flags for risky modifications
3. Maintain rollback capability

### Monitoring Setup
1. Track TypeScript warning counts
2. Monitor build success rates
3. Track bundle size changes
4. Monitor AI content processing performance
